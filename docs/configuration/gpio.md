# GPIO Settings

## GPIO Overview

You can attach external devices like buttons, switches, relays, lights or LEDs using the GPIO pins of the ESP. The _Devices_ section of the documentation contains pin descriptions and ways to set them up for specific hardware configurations.

When integrated with [Home Assistant](../integrations/home-assistant/howto.md), the configured GPIOs will be added automatically during discovery as appropriate entities in the system.

### Pin

Select the GPIO number of the input pin to use.

!!! note
    Pins known to be in use will be hidden from this list of available pins.
    Check the documentation of your board to see which pins are free to be used as GPIO.

### Group

GPIOs and objects can be grouped together by specifying a `groupid`. The state of objects in the same group is altered by the value of this input.
This allows for simple action-reaction scenarios without relying on a home automation system:

- Link a switch and relay together
- Link a push button and doorbell together

The state of a digital input can only be `on` or `off` and will set all group members to either 100% or 0% of their maximum value.

!!! note
    The grouping of multiple gpios and objects together is intended for simple actions only.
    More complex actions should be performed by a home automation system, without linking groupids together.

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    To act on the relays directly from the switch objects on the screen, try this very simple [pages.jsonl](../design/pages.md):
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":1,"obj":"switch","x":30,"y":40,"w":180,"h":75,"radius":40,"radius2":40,"groupid":1}
    {"page":1,"id":2,"obj":"switch","x":30,"y":122,"w":180,"h":75,"radius":40,"radius2":40,"groupid":2}
    {"page":1,"id":3,"obj":"switch","x":30,"y":205,"w":180,"h":75,"radius":40,"radius2":40,"groupid":3}
    ```

### Default state

The state of the input when it is *not* being engaged:
*i.e.* the switch, button or sensor is idle *(not active)*:

- **Normally Open**: The default state interrupts the circuit :material-electric-switch:
- **Normally Closed**: The default state completes the circuit :material-electric-switch-closed:

### Resistor

To avoid ghost events and RF interference each input should either have a *pullup* or *pulldown* resistor.
This ensures the signal in the default state is always `HIGH` or `LOW` respectively.

Most input pins have either an internal *pullup* or *pulldown* resistor that can be activated by the firmware.
Check the documentation of your MCU whether the pin you want to use provides this functionality.
If an internal *pullup* or *pulldown* resistor is not available on that pin you **must** add an external resistor and connect it either to `3.3V` or `GND`.

- **Internal Pullup**: The pin is pulled `HIGH` internally by the firmware 
- **Internal Pulldown**: The pin is pulled `LOW` internally by the firmware
- **External Pullup**: The pin is pulled `HIGH` by an external resistor
- **External Pulldown**: The pin is pulled `LOW` by an external resistor

### Type

- Button

A button gpio sends events to topic `input#` where `#` is the pin number.

GPIO buttons send out **events** while they occur. The possible events are:

- `down`: Occurs when a button goes from depressed to pressed
- `up`: The button was released within a short time i.e. a short click has occurred
- `long`: A single LONG event is send when the button is *still* being pressed after the threshold time of 400ms
- `release`: The button is released after being pressing for a LONG threshold time.
<!-- - `HOLD`: The HOLD event is repeated every 400ms while the button is still pressed -->
<!-- - `LOST`: This event occurs when the object looses the focus while the screen is still being touched -->


The values of objects or gpios with the same groupid will be set to maximum when the button is being pressed and to minimum when the button is released.

- Switch

A switch gpio sends events to `input#` where `#` is the groupnumber.

GPIO Switches send out their **value** when toggled: {"val":"0"} or {"val":"1"}.

The values of objects or gpios in the same group will be set to maximum when the switch is turned on
and to minimum when the switch is turned off.

!!! note "Idle State"
    The input pins do *not* affect the idle state of the device. Only interacting with the touchscreen automatically resets the idle state.

    If you want a GPIO pin to wakeup the device then you should monitor its mqtt topic and use the [`idle`](../commands.md#idle) and [`backlight`](../commands.md#backlight) commands appropriately.

## Output Pin

            </a>
</div>

### Pin

Select the GPIO number of the output pin to use.

!!! note
    Pins known to be in use will be hidden from this list of available pins.
    Check the documentation of your board to see which pins are free to be used as GPIO.

### Group

The applied value is *normalized* and *proportionate* to the value of the input object, much like a percentage:

- Binary objects, like a switch, checkbox or toggle button only pass along 0% and 100% values.
- Range objects, like a slider, arc slider, roller or drop-down list pass along a value between 0-65535, depending on their current `min`, `max` and `val` attributes.


### Type

#### Dimmable Lights:
- Led
- L8-HD (EU)
- L8-HD (AU)

Set the brightness of the light or LED between `0` and `255` when a value is received on `output#` where `#` is the groupnumber.

When a led is controlled by a button or switch in the same group, it will be turned ON or OFF according to the state of the button or switch.

When a led is controlled by a range object (slider, arc slider, roller, drop-down list) in the same group, the brightness will be proportional to the `.val` value of the object within its range (`min-max`).

!!! example

    Consider a roller or drop-down list with 4 options: `OFF`, `Low`, `Medium` and `High`.
    The `.val` values can range from 0 to 3.
    These will set the brightness of the led to 0 (0%), 84 (33%), 170 (66%) and 255 (100%) respectively.

    For a roller or drop-down list with 5 options, `.val` ranges between 0 and 4. The brightness of the led increases 25% with each step.

#### Moodlight:
- Mood Red
- Mood Green
- Mood Blue

Assigns the pin to an RGB channel of the moodlight. The three RGB channels can be controlled together using the [`moodlight`](../commands.md#moodlight) command.

#### Relays:
- Light Relay
- Power Relay

Set the relay ON or OFF when an event is received on `output#` where `#` is the groupnumber or from another group `intput`.

When a relay is grouped with a button or switch in the same group, it will be turned ON or OFF according to the state of the button or switch.

When a relay is controlled by a range object (slider, arc slider, roller, drop-down list) within the same group, the state will be be ON if the `val` value is larger then its `min` value.

The various relay types (Light, Power) denote only the device class you want them to be autodetected as in Home Assistant: _light_ vs. _switch_ etc.

!!! danger "Warning"
    Attaching devices to mains power can be dangerous!
    Configuring gpios is done on your **own responsibility**.
    Be sure to test any system thoroughly using low voltages first.
    By using the firmware you accept the [License](../license.md).

Use the hasp/<platename>/command/output[x] topic (where x is the pin number) with an empty payload to query the current state of the relay.

```jsonl
hasp/my_plate/command/output27
hasp/my_plate/state/output27 {"state":"off"}
```

#### PWM

*Experimental*

Set the duty cycle of the pin between `0` and `4095` when a value is received on `output#` where `#` is the groupnumber or from another group `intput`.

When the PWM gpio is grouped with a button or switch, its duty cycle is either set to full-duty or off according to the state of the button or switch.

When the PWM gpio is grouped with range object (slider, arc slider, roller, drop-down list), the duty cycle is proportional to the `.val` value of the object within its range (`min-max`).
