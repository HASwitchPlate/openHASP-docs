<h1>Installation</h1>

## Download the firmware

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/openHASP/releases) page on GitHub to download the latest openHASP binaries.

Pick the one appropriate for ESP8266:

- d1-mini-esp8266_ili9341_v0.3.2.bin

!!! note
    You can also download the *nightly* openHASP firmware.zip file from the [Actions tab](https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/openHASP/actions) on Github.

## Install the firmware

### Flash ESP8266

For ESP8266 you only need one single `.bin` file:

#### Using [Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer) (Windows)

#### Using esp-tool.py

When flashing the ESP8266 for the first time, it is best to erase the flash before uploading the new firmware:

```shell
esptool.py -p "COM1" erase_flash
esptool.py -p "COM1" write_flash --flash_mode qio 0x0 d1-mini-esp8266_ili9341_v0.3.2.bin
```

Change `COM1` to the correct port on your computer and `4m` to the correct size of the internal flash chip.
