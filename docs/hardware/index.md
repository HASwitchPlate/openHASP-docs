# Getting Started

openHASP supports the ESP32 family of microcontrollers.
It needs a compatible micro-controller with drivers supporting the attached display, touch controller, storage and network.

Below is a list of recommended devices, development boards and touchscreens to get you up-and-running in no time.

## Recommended Devices

For new projects we recommend ESP32-S3 boards with at least 520 kB SRAM, 8MB of flash and 2MB PSram.
A capacitive touchscreen is also highly prefered because it is more responsive over resistive touchscreens.

!!! note
    We do not recommend using an ESP32-S2 because it only has 320 kB of SRAM.

Due to the large number of possible hardware options a selection of 3 popular ESP development boards
has been made for the precompiled binaries. Please have a look at the list of [recommended boards](../firmware/index.md#recommended-boards).

## Other Supported Devices

Support for additional devices is primarily maintained through the contributions of our users. While
the experience with these devices can be excellent, it may also vary significantly. Due to the vast
array of hardware combinations available, it is not feasible for the maintainers to offer uniform
support across all devices. However, we strive to keep the project's scope broad and inclusive.

For a comprehensive list of supported devices, please refer to the section on the left. We encourage
you to thoroughly review the device-specific pages before starting a new project, as this will
provide you with valuable insights into the level of support each device offers. If you have any
uncertainties, we recommend using the boards highlighted in the "Recommended Devices" section to
ensure a smoother experience.
