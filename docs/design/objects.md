<h1>Objects</h1>

There are two ways to create an object on the screen:

- Uploading a [`pages.jsonl`](pages.md#pagesjsonl) file onto the internal flash
- Use the [`jsonl`](../commands.md#jsonl) command *(via MQTT, serial or telnet console)*

## Common Parameters

### Common Properties

These are the common properties shared among all objects,
but only the `id` and `obj` properties are required to create an object:

| Property | | Value        | Required | Default | Description
|:---------|-|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:----
| id       | | 1..254       | yes      | n/a     | ID of the object on this page. `0` for the page itself.
| obj      | | [string][10] | yes      | n/a     | Name of the object type _(see below)_ 
| page     | | 0..12        | no       | n/a     | ID of the page the object appears on _(see below)_
| groupid  | | 0..15        | no       | 0 (none)| ID of the [GPIO group][3] the object belongs to
| x        | | [int16][9]   | no       | 0       | Horizontal position on the page
| y        | | [int16][9]   | no       | 0       | Vertical position on the page
| w        | | [int16][9]   | no       | 0       | Width of the object
| h        | | [int16][9]   | no       | 0       | Height of the object
| hidden   | | [bool][2]    | no       | false   | Object is hidden
| opacity  | | 0..255       | no       | 255     | How much the the object is opaque
| action   | | [string][10] | no       | 0       | Command handled locally _(see below)_
| swipe    | | [bool][2]    | no       | false   | Page navigation using swipe gestures _(see below)_
| click    | | [bool][2]    | no       | true    | Object is touch/clickable _(also see [enabled][4])_
| ext_click_h | :material-new-box:{ .tag-small } | 0..255 | no       | 0       | Extended horizontal clickable are on the left and right 
| ext_click_v | :material-new-box:{ .tag-small } | 0..255 | no       | 0       | Extended vertical clickable are on the top and bottom
| parentid | :material-new-box:{ .tag-small }    | 0..255 | no       | 0       | Set the object to be the child of another object.<br>`x` and `y` will be relative to the parent object. _Property inheritance can affect the appearance of the of the children (more info in [styling][12])_.

!!! tip
    Further customizable properties can be found in [styling][12].

Ids start from 1 on _each page_.
You can have a maximum of 254 ids on each page. You don't have to use them in ascending order, you can for example use them for logical numbering (start labels from 11, 12, 13, buttons from 21, 22, 23 etc.)
   
#### Pages  
If the `page` parameter is not present, the object is placed on the same page as the _previous object_. If `page` is not specified for the first object either, the _current page_ being displayed is used.

`"page":0` indicates that the object is visible on **all** pages. It can be used for example to specify a static menu bar.
You can still hide the object on select pages if needed. Objects on page 0 appear on **top** of any objects on the underlying page.

#### Actions  
Action commands are supported only by _binary_ or _visual_ type of objects and they are performed locally on the plate. The following actions can be set for these objects:

- `p1` to `p12` to switch to the corresponding page numbers directly (for ESP32; in case of ESP8266 it's only `p1` to `p4`)
- `prev` to switch to the previous page
- `next` to switch to the next page
- `back` to go back to the home page

Check out the [example](../integrations/examples/example-pagination.md) for how to implement actions.  
You can change the target pages using `prev`, `back` and `next` [page attributes](pages.md#page-attributes) operation on the page object`pXb0`.  

#### Swipe <a name="swipe"></a>
Objects and page area (`p0bY`) support `swipe` property. Enabling this will process `left`, `right` and `down` swipes on the object as `next`, `prev` and `back` page changes, respectively. The start of the swipe needs to be on the element which has this property enabled for the feature to activate.  

!!! Note
    Page id `p0b0` is not valid to set this property as it has to be set on real elements. 

### Events

All objects are touchable by default and respond to touch events. To disable touch events for an object set its `enabled` property to `false`. In this case the touch event "goes through" to the object on the layer below or to the page itself.

Events (and values) are published in a state topic corresponding to the object, eg. `hasp/<nodename>/state/p1b2` with payload in json format eg. `{"event":"up","val":1}`.  
Possible events (depending on object type) are:

| Event   | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `down`| Occurs when a button goes from depressed to pressed (the moment of touch)|
| `up`| The button was released within a short time i.e. a short press has occurred|
| `release`| The button is released after being pressed for over the threshold time|
| `long` | Event is sent when the button is *still* being pressed after the threshold time of 400ms|
| `hold`| The HOLD event is repeated every 200ms while the button is still pressed|
| `changed` | Event is sent when the value of the object has changed during the event|
<!-- - `LOST`: This event occurs when the object looses the focus while the screen is still being touched -->

!!! tip
    To actively see the sent out events you can use an MQTT client app and subscribe to the `hasp/#` topic.

### Common Methods

These are the common methods shared among all objects,

| Method   | Parameters | Description |
|:---------|:----------:|:------------|
| `clear`   :material-new-box:{ .tag-small } |            | Delete the children from the object
| `delete`   |            | Delete the object and its children from the page
| `to_front` |            | Bring the object to the front on the page
| `to_back`  |            | Send the object to the back on the page

Example commands:

```json
p1b5.delete
p1b3.to_front
```
<H2>Object Types</H2>

Each object type is an ID that indicates which object type that line represents.
Besides the common properties listed above, each object type can have specific properties.

## Text Label
**obj:`label`**

![lv_label](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_label_1.png)

| Property | Value      | Default    | Description
|----------|------------|------------|--------------
| text     | [string][10]     | "Text"     | The text of the label, `\n` for line break. Can also be a [variable][15].
| mode     | [string][10]     | `crop`     | The wrapping mode of long text labels:<br>`expand` Expand the object size to the text size<br>`break` Keep the object width, break the too long lines and expand the object height<br>`dots` Keep the size and write dots at the end if the text is too long<br>`scroll` Keep the size and roll the text back and forth<br>`loop` Keep the size and roll the text circularly<br>`crop` Keep the size and crop the text out of it
| align    | [string][10]       | `left`       | Text alignment: `left`, `center`, `right` 

It's possible to set the color of characters in the text indvidually, just prefix the text to be re-colored with a `#RRGGBB` hexadecimal color code and a space, and close with a single hash `#` tag.

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":1,"obj":"label","x":10,"y":5,"w":150,"h":50,"text":"\uE64A Hello world!"}
    {"page":1,"id":1,"obj":"label","x":10,"y":5,"w":150,"h":50,"text":"#0000FF \uE64A# #FF0000 Hello# #008000 world#!"}
    ```

## Button
**obj:`btn`**

![lv_btn](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_btn_1.png)

| Property | Value      | Default | Description
|----------|------------|---------|--------------
| toggle   | [bool][2]  | false   | When enabled, creates a toggle-on/toggle-off button. If false, creates a normal button
| val      | [int16][9]      | 0       | The value: `0` = untoggled, `1` = toggled
| text     | [string][10]     | ""      | The text of the label
| mode     | [string][10]     | `expand`| The wrapping mode of long text labels.<br>`expand` Expand the object size to the text size<br>`break` Keep the object width, break the too long lines and expand the object height<br>`dots` Keep the size and write dots at the end if the text is too long<br>`scroll` Keep the size and roll the text back and forth<br>`loop` Keep the size and roll the text circularly<br>`crop` Keep the size and crop the text out of it
| align    | [string][10]       | `left`       | Text alignment: `left`, `center`, `right` 

Similar to the text label, it's possible to set the color of characters in the text indvidually, just prefix the text to be re-colored with a `#RRGGBB` hexadecimal color code and a space, and close with a single hash `#` tag.

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":2,"obj":"btn","x":10,"y":40,"w":105,"h":90,"toggle":false,"text":"Normal Button","mode":"break","align":"center"}
    {"page":1,"id":3,"obj":"btn","x":125,"y":40,"w":105,"h":90,"toggle":true,"text":"#FFD700 Toggle# Button","mode":"break","align":"center"}
    ```

**Normal** buttons (`toggle=false`) send touch events while they occur: 

Short touch:
```json
{"event":"down"}
{"event":"up"}
```

Long press:
```json
{"event":"down"}
{"event":"long"}
{"event":"hold"}
{"event":"hold"}
{"event":"release"}
```

**Toggle** buttons (`toggle=true`) send out the old value in the `down` event and the new value in the `up` event when released:

Toggle ON:
```json
{"event":"down","val":0}
{"event":"up","val":1}
```

Toggle OFF:
```json
{"event":"down","val":1}
{"event":"up","val":0}
```


## Switch

| bg_color1  | [color][1] | 0       | changes indicator color
| bg_color2  | [color][1] | 0       | changes knob color
| radius2    | [int16][9]      | depends<BR>on theme | changes knob corner radius (also see [radius](#common-properties))

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":4,"obj":"switch","x":125,"y":145,"w":105,"h":55,"radius":15}

| text     | [string][10]     | "Checkbox" | The label of the checkbox

!!! note
    The checkbox object ignores the `w` and `h` attribute. These are calculated
    based on the font and text.

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":5,"obj":"checkbox","x":10,"y":145,"w":105,"text":" Checkbox"}
    ```

| end_angle1 | 0-360     |         | end angle of the arc indicator (see note)


!!! note
    Zero degree is at the middle right (3 o'clock) of the object and the degrees are increasing in a clockwise direction. The angles should be in the [0-360] range.     
    `min`, `max` and `val` support also negative values.

!!! tip
    To adjust the size of the knob, use `pad_top2`, `pad_bottom2`, `pad_left2`, `pad_right2` [styling][13] properties. If you increase the knob beyond the margins of the object, you also need to increase `pad_top`, `pad_bottom`, `pad_left`, `pad_right` for the arc itself.    
    Check out [value styling][6] to display a textual value in the middle of the arc.     

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":9,"obj":"arc","x":20,"y":75,"w":200,"h":200,"min":15,"max":35,"border_side":0,"type":0,"rotation":0,"start_angle":135,"end_angle":45,"start_angle1":135,"end_angle1":45,"adjustable":true}

| rotation       | 0-360      | 0       | offset for the gauge's angles to rotate it
| format         | [uint16][9]     | 0       | divider for major tick values

To strip trailing zero's of major tick labels the `format` divider can be used to scale the values before printing:

- `0` : print the major tick value as is
- `1` : strip 1 zero, i.e. divide tick value by 10 before printing the major tick label
- `2` : strip 2 zeros, i.e. divide tick value by 100 before printing the major tick label
- `3` : strip 3 zeros, i.e. divide tick value by 1000 before printing the major tick label
- `4` : strip 4 zeros, i.e. divide tick value by 10000 before printing the major tick label

Only these values are allowed, arbitrary numbers are not supported.

!!! note
    `min`, `max` and `val` support also negative values.
   
??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json

Use [scale][8] properties to customize.


## Tabview  :material-new-box:{ .tag-medium }  
**obj:`tabview`**

![lv_tabview](../assets/images/objects/lv_ex_tabview_1.png)

A tabview is an object that can hold multiple tab objects.
You first create the `tabview` object and then add `tab` objects to it.

| Property | Value        | Default | Description
|----------|--------------|---------|--------------------------
| val      | [int8][9]    | 0       | The number of the active tab, starting at 0
| text     | [string][10] | ""      | The name of the active tab
| btn_pos  | 0..4         | 1       | Position of the tab buttons:</br>`0` = none</br>`1` = top</br>`2` = bottom</br>`3` = left</br>`4` = right
| count    | [uint16][9]  | 0       | *Read-only* The number of tabs of the tabview

To change the currently visible tab, use the `val` attribute after all tabs have been added.   

!!! note
    To adjust the height of the tab buttons row, use `pad_top1` and `pad_bottom1` [styling][13] properties. Accepts also negative values.     
    To adjust the text size of the tab names, use the `text_font1` [styling][14] property.    

Read further down to learn now to add tabs to the tabview.


## Tab  :material-new-box:{ .tag-medium }  
**obj:`tab`**

| text     | [string][10] | "Tab"   | The name of tab button

Set the parent object (which `tabview` the tabs belong to) by referencing the `parentid` when creating the tab.
To add other objects to these tabs, set the `parentid` when creating those objects to the _id of the tab_ you wamt them to appear on.

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":14,"obj":"tabview","btn_pos":1,"y":180}
    {"page":1,"id":51,"obj":"tab","parentid":14,"text":"Tab 1"}
    {"page":1,"id":52,"obj":"tab","parentid":14,"text":"Tab 2"}
    {"page":1,"id":53,"obj":"tab","parentid":14,"text":"Tab 3"}
    {"page":1,"id":61,"obj":"switch","x":20,"y":10,"w":60,"h":30,"parentid":51,"radius":25,"radius2":25}
    {"page":1,"id":71,"obj":"dropdown","x":15,"y":10,"w":110,"h":30,"parentid":52,"options":"Apple\nBanana\nOrange\nMelon"}
    {"page":1,"id":81,"obj":"checkbox","x":15,"y":10,"w":110,"h":30,"parentid":53,"text":" Nice tabview"}

| pad_inner | [int16][9]       | 10      | The padding between the circle and the inner preview circle

The object will automatically adjust based on the `w` and `h` properties: when the object is longer then it is height a rectangular color picker is created, otherwise it will be circular.

By long pressing the inner preview circle, the color picker will through the color modes: hue > saturation > value. Double-click on the inner preview circle to reset the current value.

#### Setting Color

Example MQTT commands:
```json
hasp/<nodename>/command/p0b2.color 13891
hasp/<nodename>/command/p1b5.color silver
hasp/<nodename>/command/p2b3.color #C0C0C0
```

#### Events

While pressing and dragging the `cpicker` object the following events are sent: `down` (old color), `changed` (repeatedly until released) and `up` (value at the moment of releasing it):

```json
{"event":"down","color":"#8300ff","r":131,"g":0,"b":255}
{"event":"changed","color":"#7300ff","r":115,"g":0,"b":255}
{"event":"changed","color":"#6200ff","r":98,"g":0,"b":255}
{"event":"up","color":"#6200ff","r":98,"g":0,"b":255}

!!! note
    Placing objects over/under the spinner will increase the CPU load because all objects need to be redrawn constantly.

??? example "Example `jsonl`"
    ```json
    {"page":1,"id":15,"obj":"spinner","x":180,"y":50,"w":36,"h":36,"bg_opa":0,"border_width":0,"line_width":6,"line_width1":6,"angle":80,"line_color":"white","line_color1":"green"}
