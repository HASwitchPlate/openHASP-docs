# Styling Properties

You can adjust the appearance of objects by changing the foreground, background and/or border color of each object. Some objects allow for more complex styling, effectively changing their appearance or their sub-components.     

Certain more complex objects are made up of several sub-parts, which can be styled separately. To access the properties of the parts use a number suffix appended to the property.

!!! tip
    For example the _gauge_ object uses `line_width` to set the minor ticks thickness, `line_width1` for major ticks and `line_width2` for the thickness of the needle.      
    _Note:_ not all the suffixed properties are mentioned in this documentation, feel free to discover them yourself.


If objects are children of other objects (they have the [parentid][7] property set), property inheritance takes place. 

!!! Inheritance
    Some properties (typically that are related to text and opacity) can be inherited from the parent object's styles. Inheritance is applied only if the given property is not set in the initial jsonl of the child object (at first draw). In this case, if the property is inheritable, the property's value will be searched in the parents too until an object specifies a value for the property. The parents will use their own state to detemine the value. So for example if a button is pressed, and the text color comes from here, the pressed text color will be used. ([source][8]{target=_blank}) Inheritance takes place at run time too.

## General

General styling options.

| Property     | Value      | Default | Description
|:-------------|:----------:|:-------:|:-----------
| enabled      | [bool][2]  | true    | Object is touchable, if `false`, a _disabled_ style is applied
| radius       | [uint16][3]| depends<BR>on theme | The radius of the rounded corners of the object:<BR>0 = square corners<BR>100 = pill shaped object (true circle if object has same width and height)
| clip_corner  | [bool][2] | false   | Enable to clip off the overflowed content on the rounded (`radius` > `0`) corners of the object


## Background

The color and gradient used for drawing the background of an object.

| Property       |   Type   | Description
| :---           |   :---:  | :---
| bg_opa         | [uint8][3]     | The background opacity level
| bg_color       |[color][1]| The background color
| bg_grad_color  |[color][1]| The background gradient color
| bg_grad_dir    | [0..2]   | 0 = none *(=default)*<br>1 = horizontal<br>2 = vertical
| bg_grad_stop   | [uint8][3]     | Specifies where the gradient should stop.<br>0 = at left/top most position<br>255= at right/bottom most position *(=default)*
| bg_main_stop   | [uint8][3]     | Specifies where should the gradient start<br>0 = at left/top most position *(=default)*<br>255= at right/bottom most position

To adjust the background style of a page use `pXb0` where `X` is the page number.

## Border

The border is drawn on top of the background. It has radius rounding.

| Property     |  Type    | Description
| :---         |  :---:   | :---
| border_color |[color][1]| Specifies the color of the border
| border_opa   | [uint8][3]     | Specifies opacity of the border
| border_width | [uint8][3]     | Set the width of the border
| border_side  | [uint8][3]     | Specifies which sides of the border to draw.<br>0 = none<br>1 = bottom<br>2 = top<br>4 = left<br>8 = right<br>15 = full<br>A sum of these values is also possible to select specific sides.
| border_post  | [bool][2]| If `true` the border will be drawn after all children have been drawn.

## Padding and Margin

Padding sets the space on the inner sides of the edges. It means "I don't want my children too close to my sides, so keep this space". Padding inner sets the "gap" between the children. Margin sets the space on the outer side of the edges. It means "I want this space around me".

Objects use them to set spacing. See the documentation of the [objects](objects.md) for the details.
