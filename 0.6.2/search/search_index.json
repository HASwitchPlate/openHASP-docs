While the HASPone project uses a Wemos D1 mini and requires a Nextion/TJC HMI display, this rewrite removes the Nextion/TJC requirement by using the Light and Versatile Graphics Library on the MCU to drive a commodity display. This project also adds ESP32 and STM32F4 support to take advantage of the additional hardware capabilities.

Issuing commands ~ Commands can be issued via the Serial commandline, telnet commandline or MQTT. For MQTT, use the hasp/<nodename>/command topic with payload <keyword> <parameter(s)> Batch processinng ~ Commands can be processed in batch one after another from .cmd script files located in the flash storage of the plate. General rules when creating .cmd batch scripts: can contain any command empty lines are ignored # or // can be used for comments space or tab in front of a command is ignored lines starting with { are processed as jsonl payloads lines starting with [ are processed as json payloads other lines are processed as <command> <payload> CR , LF or CRLF line endings allowed UTF8 encoding is required for special characters To start a batch script, use run command. System scripts ~ If any of the following scripts is present on the filesystem, it will be run automatically according to the rules below: /online.cmd will be executed after connection to the network was successfull /offline.cmd will be executed after connection to the WiFi is lost This makes it possible to disable or hide buttons, load a special offline page, etc. See example . Global commands ~ run ~ accepted parameters: name of a .cmd or .jsonl file present on the flash filesystem of the plate. Filename must be preceeded by the / character Run a batch script or load a jsonl page. Example run /script.cmd run /pages_party_mode.jsonl jsonl ~ accepted parameters: one or more json formatted lines Create new objects or update the properties of an existing object. When updating an existing object the obj property is not required and will be ignored. Each line in the jsonl payload defines one object and has to be in the json format. If the payload exceeds the MQTT buffer of 2 kB it will be cut off to fit, don't send too many lines in a single payload, you can always sends multiple jsonl commands. Example 1 jso nl { \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"id\" : 14 , \"x\" : 120 , \"y\" : 1 , \"w\" : 30 , \"h\" : 40 , \"text_font\" : \"2\" , \"text\" : \"Test\" , \"text_color\" : \"gray\" , \"bg_opa\" : 0 , \"border_width\" : 0 } For more details see Pages and Objects . json ~ accepted parameters: json array of strings Use the json command to send multiple commands as an array of strings in one payload. Example 1 jso n [ 'page 3 ' , 'backligh t { \"state\" : \"OFF\" , \"brightness\" : 100 } ' , 'idle o ff ' ] This command will change to page 3, turn the backlight on at ~40% brightness and reset the idle timer. page ~ accepted parameters: [1-12] , prev , next or back Switches the display to show the objects from a different page and return the page number in state/page . Calling the page command without a parameter will return the value of the current page in state/page . clearpage ~ accepted parameters: [0-12] or all Deletes all objects on a given page. If no page number is specified, it clears the current page. Use clearpage all to clear all objects on all pages. To delete individual objects, you can issue the pXbY.delete command. backlight ~ accepted json keys: state: on / off , true / false , 0 / 1 , yes / no brightness: 1..255 Example backlight {\"state\":\"on\",\"brightness\":128} sets the display to half the brightness. Instead of a json payload, you can use a simple payload. To change the state, use either on / off , true / false , 0 , yes / no . A simple integer payload of 1..255 will adjust the brightness. Example backlight off backlight 200 sets the display brightness to ~80%. moodlight ~ accepted json keys: state: on / off , true / false , 0 / 1 , yes / no brightness: 1..255 color or r, g, b: 0..255 An RGB moodlight can be controlled by configuring 3 GPIO pins as type Mood Red , Mood Green and Mood blue . These leds can then be controlled together using the moodlight command. Example 1 2 3 4 moodligh t { \"state\" : \"off\" , \"color\" : \"green\" } moodligh t { \"state\" : true , \"color\" : \"#ff00e7\" } moodligh t { \"color\" : 12345 } moodligh t { \"state\" : \"on\" , \"r\" : 255 , \"g\" : 0 , \"b\" : 255 } The state key accepts boolean values to turn the moodlight on or off The brightness key can be set between 1 and 255 to dim the moodlight The color key accepts color values to set the RGB channels at once Individual r , g and b keys can also be used to set each channel seperately Calling the moodlight command without parameters (or sending an empty payload to the hasp/<nodename>/command/moodlight topic) returns the current state: Example 1 \"state/moodlight\" { \"state\" : \"ON\" , \"brightness\" : 255 , \"color\" : \"#ff0000\" , \"r\" : 255 , \"g\" : 0 , \"b\" : 0 } The color is returned as a hexadecimal value and as individual RGB channels. idle ~ accepted parameters: off Clears the idle state of the device and publishes a state/idle = OFF status message. It resets the idle counter as if a touch event occurred on the device. This is helpful e.g. when you want to wake up the display when an external event has occurred, like a PIR motion sensor. Calling the idle command without a parameter will return the current idle state short , long or off in the state/idle topic. output[x] ~ where [x] is number of the gpio pin (0-39) accepted json keys: state: on / off , true / false , 0 / 1 , yes / no val: 0..255 Changes the state GPIO pin to on or off . If the pin is configured as a LED or Serial Dimmer then the val key will control the brightness. Note If the GPIO is assigned to a group then objects and other GPIOs that share the same groupid will change state accordingly. input[x] ~ where [x] is number of the gpio pin (0-39) read-only Returns a JSON object containing the current state of the input, either on or off Example 1 i n pu t 4 => { \"state\" : \"on\" } System Commands ~ calibrate ~ Start on-screen touch calibration. You need to issue a soft reboot command to save the new calibration settings. If you do a hard reset of the device, the calibration settings will be lost. screenshot ~ Saves a picture of the current screen to the flash filesystem. You can retrieve it via http://<ip-address>/screenshot.bmp. This can be handy for bug reporting or documentation. The previous screenshot is overwritten. statusupdate ~ Reports the status of the MCU. The response will be posted to the state topic.

You can upload uncompressed ZIP files to the flash space of your plate and unzip them locally. This is useful for cases when you need a lot of small files to be uploaded - putting them in an uncompressed zip allows to upload them in one go, and then extract them with a single command: Example 1 unzip /openhasp-weathericons-day.zip service ~ Start or stop some of the processes running on the plate. Currently supported parameters: start stop Currently supported services: http (web interface) telnet (remote console) console (serial console) Example To stop the web interface of the plate, send to topic hasp/<your_plate>/command/service the string stop http . To start the web interface of the plate, send to topic hasp/<your_plate>/command/service the string start http . Tip Once these services are stopped, connection is lost/not possible to the plate through them. They can be started at any time by sending service start commands in through MQTT. It's possible to create self-built firmware binaries which have services stopped by default at boot, using customization . reboot or restart ~ Saves any changes in the configuration file and reboots the device. update ~ accepted parameters: [url] Update the firmware from the url provided. Reboots when update was successful. factoryreset ~ Clear the filesystem and EEPROM and reboot the device in its initial state. Warning There is no confirmation prompt nor an undo function! Configuration Settings ~ Wi-FI ~ ssid ~ Set network name of the access point to connect to. pass ~ Set the optional password for the access point to connect to. MQTT ~ nodename ~ Set the nodename of the device and mqtt topic for the node to hasp/<nodename>/ mqtthost ~ Set the IP address or nodename of the mqtt broker. mqttport ~ Set the port of the mqtt broker. mqttuser ~ Set the optional username for the mqtt broker. mqttpass ~ Set the optional password for the mqtt broker. config/submodule ~ You can get or set the configuration of an openHASP submodule in json format. To get the configuration, use the command config/<submodule> : config/wifi config/mqtt config/http config/mdns config/hasp config/gui config/debug config/gpio The result will be published to hasp/<nodename>/state/config . Passwords will be omitted from the result. To update the configuration simply issue the same command config/<submodule> with updated json payload. Example config/gui {\"idle2\":0} disable long idle (don't turn off the screen completely) config/debug {\"tele\":300} set the telemetry period to 300 seconds config/hasp {\"startdim\":255} to set the startup brightness to 255","title":"Commands"},{"location":"commands/#issuing-commands","text":"Commands can be issued via the Serial commandline, telnet commandline or MQTT.

If you have another ESP or MCU, you can still use this display using jumper cables. You can also solder a row of headers at the bottom of the display to plug it into a breadboard. Therefor the Lolin TFT 2.4 Touch Shield is used as the development display of choice. Backlight Control ~ To use PWM dimming on the Lolin TFT 2.4\" you must connect the TFT-LED pin to either D1, D2 or D4. D1 is recommended for backlight control and configured by default. Do not use D3 for backlight control because it is already in use for touch! It is not recommended to use D4 for backlight control because it is already in use for PSram on the ESP32-Wrover.

The Devices section of the documentation contains pin descriptions and ways to set them up for specific hardware configurations. When integrated with Home Assistant , the configured GPIOs will be added automatically during discovery as appropriate entities in the system. Input Pin ~ Pin ~ Select the GPIO number of the input pin to use. Note Pins known to be in use will be hidden from this list of available pins. Check the documentation of your board to see which pins are free to be used as GPIO. Group ~ GPIOs and objects can be grouped together by specifying a groupid . The state of objects in the same group is altered by the value of this input. This allows for simple action-reaction scenarios without relying on a home automation system: Link a switch and relay together Link a push button and doorbell together The state of a digital input can only be on or off and will set all group members to either 100% or 0% of their maximum value. Note The grouping of multiple gpios and objects together is intended for simple actions only. More complex actions should be performed by a home automation system, without linking groupids together. Example jsonl To act on the relays directly from the switch objects on the screen, try this very simple pages.jsonl : 1 2 3 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"switch\" , \"x\" : 30 , \"y\" : 40 , \"w\" : 180 , \"h\" : 75 , \"radius\" : 40 , \"radius2\" : 40 , \"groupid\" : 1 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 2 , \"obj\" : \"switch\" , \"x\" : 30 , \"y\" : 122 , \"w\" : 180 , \"h\" : 75 , \"radius\" : 40 , \"radius2\" : 40 , \"groupid\" : 2 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 3 , \"obj\" : \"switch\" , \"x\" : 30 , \"y\" : 205 , \"w\" : 180 , \"h\" : 75 , \"radius\" : 40 , \"radius2\" : 40 , \"groupid\" : 3 } Default state ~ The state of the input when it is not being engaged: i.e. the switch, button or sensor is idle (not active) : Normally Open : The default state interrupts the circuit Normally Closed : The default state completes the circuit Resistor ~ To avoid ghost events and RF interference each input should either have a pullup or pulldown resistor. This ensures the signal in the default state is always HIGH or LOW respectively. Most input pins have either an internal pullup or pulldown resistor that can be activated by the firmware. Check the documentation of your MCU whether the pin you want to use provides this functionality. If an internal pullup or pulldown resistor is not available on that pin you must add an external resistor and connect it either to 3.3V or GND . Internal Pullup : The pin is pulled HIGH internally by the firmware Internal Pulldown : The pin is pulled LOW internally by the firmware External Pullup : The pin is pulled HIGH by an external resistor External Pulldown : The pin is pulled LOW by an external resistor Type ~ Button A button gpio sends events to topic input# where # is the pin number. GPIO buttons send out events while they occur. The possible events are: down : Occurs when a button goes from depressed to pressed up : The button was released within a short time i.e. a short click has occurred long : A single LONG event is send when the button is still being pressed after the threshold time of 400ms release : The button is released after being pressing for a LONG threshold time. The values of objects or gpios with the same groupid will be set to maximum when the button is being pressed and to minimum when the button is released. Switch A switch gpio sends events to input# where # is the groupnumber. GPIO Switches send out their value when toggled: {\"val\":\"0\"} or {\"val\":\"1\"}. The values of objects or gpios in the same group will be set to maximum when the switch is turned on and to minimum when the switch is turned off. Idle State The input pins do not affect the idle state of the device. Only interacting with the touchscreen automatically resets the idle state. If you want a GPIO pin to wakeup the device then you should monitor its mqtt topic and use the idle and backlight commands appropriately. Output Pin ~ Pin ~ Select the GPIO number of the output pin to use. Note Pins known to be in use will be hidden from this list of available pins. Check the documentation of your board to see which pins are free to be used as GPIO. Group ~ The applied value is normalized and proportionate to the value of the input object, much like a percentage: Binary objects, like a switch, checkbox or toggle button only pass along 0% and 100% values. Range objects, like a slider, arc slider, roller or drop-down list pass along a value between 0-65535, depending on their current min , max and val attributes. Type ~ Dimmable Lights: ~ Led L8-HD (EU) L8-HD (AU) Set the brightness of the light or LED between 0 and 255 when a value is received on output# where # is the groupnumber. When a led is controlled by a button or switch in the same group, it will be turned ON or OFF according to the state of the button or switch. When a led is controlled by a range object (slider, arc slider, roller, drop-down list) in the same group, the brightness will be proportional to the .val value of the object within its range ( min-max ). Example Consider a roller or drop-down list with 4 options: OFF , Low , Medium and High . The .val values can range from 0 to 3. These will set the brightness of the led to 0 (0%), 84 (33%), 170 (66%) and 255 (100%) respectively. For a roller or drop-down list with 5 options, .val ranges between 0 and 4. The brightness of the led increases 25% with each step. Moodlight: ~ Mood Red Mood Green Mood Blue Assigns the pin to an RGB channel of the moodlight. The three RGB channels can be controlled together using the moodlight command. Relays: ~ Light Relay Power Relay Set the relay ON or OFF when an event is received on output# where # is the groupnumber or from another group intput . When a relay is grouped with a button or switch in the same group, it will be turned ON or OFF according to the state of the button or switch. When a relay is controlled by a range object (slider, arc slider, roller, drop-down list) within the same group, the state will be be ON if the val value is larger then its min value. The various relay types (Light, Power) denote only the device class you want them to be autodetected as in Home Assistant: light vs. switch etc. Warning Attaching devices to mains power can be dangerous! Configuring gpios is done on your own responsibility . Be sure to test any system thoroughly using low voltages first. By using the firmware you accept the License . Use the hasp/ /command/output[x] topic (where x is the pin number) with an empty payload to query the current state of the relay. 1 2 hasp/my_plate/command/output27 hasp/my_plate/state/output27 {\"state\":\"off\"} PWM ~ Experimental Set the duty cycle of the pin between 0 and 4095 when a value is received on output# where # is the groupnumber or from another group intput . When the PWM gpio is grouped with a button or switch, its duty cycle is either set to full-duty or off according to the state of the button or switch. When the PWM gpio is grouped with range object (slider, arc slider, roller, drop-down list), the duty cycle is proportional to the .val value of the object within its range ( min-max ).

on / off depending on the context. Integer ~ Numeric properties have integer values with a variable minimum and maximum input value. Certain object properties also support negative values. Details int8 (signed) supports values ranging from -128 to 127. uint8 (unsigned) supports values ranging from 0 to 255. int16 (signed) supports values ranging from -32768 to 32767. uint16 (unsigned) supports values ranging from 0 to 65535. String ~ Properties that accept textual input. When sending raw text in the MQTT payload or as command parameter no quotes are needed. Only when a text value is included in a jsonl or json command, it needs to be quoted accoring to JSON rules. JSON Object ~ Some properties can be set or retrieved in JSON format too.

Property inheritance can affect the appearance of the of the children (more info in styling ) . Tip Further customizable properties can be found in styling . Ids start from 1 on each page . You can have a maximum of 254 ids on each page. You don't have to use them in ascending order, you can for example use them for logical numbering (start labels from 11, 12, 13, buttons from 21, 22, 23 etc.) Pages ~ If the page parameter is not present, the object is placed on the same page as the previous object . If page is not specified for the first object either, the current page being displayed is used. \"page\":0 indicates that the object is visible on all pages. It can be used for example to specify a static menu bar. You can still hide the object on select pages if needed. Objects on page 0 appear on top of any objects on the underlying page. Actions ~ Action commands are supported only by binary or visual type of objects and they are performed locally on the plate. The following actions can be set for these objects: p1 to p12 to switch to the corresponding page numbers directly (for ESP32; in case of ESP8266 it's only p1 to p4 ) prev to switch to the previous page next to switch to the next page back to go back to the home page Check out the example for how to implement actions. You can change the target pages using prev , back and next page attributes operation on the page object pXb0 . Swipe ~ Objects and page area ( p0bY ) support swipe property. Enabling this will process left , right and down swipes on the object as next , prev and back page changes, respectively. The start of the swipe needs to be on the element which has this property enabled for the feature to activate. Note Page id p0b0 is not valid to set this property as it has to be set on real elements. Events ~ All objects are touchable by default and respond to touch events. To disable touch events for an object set its enabled property to false . In this case the touch event \"goes through\" to the object on the layer below or to the page itself. Events (and values) are published in a state topic corresponding to the object, eg. hasp/<nodename>/state/p1b2 with payload in json format eg. {\"event\":\"up\",\"val\":1} . Possible events (depending on object type) are: Event Description down Occurs when a button goes from depressed to pressed (the moment of touch) up The button was released within a short time i.e. a short press has occurred release The button is released after being pressed for over the threshold time long Event is sent when the button is still being pressed after the threshold time of 400ms hold The HOLD event is repeated every 200ms while the button is still pressed changed Event is sent when the value of the object has changed during the event Tip To actively see the sent out events you can use an MQTT client app and subscribe to the hasp/# topic. Common Methods ~ These are the common methods shared among all objects, Method Parameters Description clear Delete the children from the object delete Delete the object and its children from the page to_front Bring the object to the front on the page to_back Send the object to the back on the page Example commands: 1 2 p 1 b 5. dele te p 1 b 3. t o_ fr o nt Object Types Each object type is an ID that indicates which object type that line represents. Besides the common properties listed above, each object type can have specific properties. Text Label ~ obj: label Property Value Default Description text string \"Text\" The text of the label, \\n for line break. Can also be a variable . mode string crop The wrapping mode of long text labels: expand Expand the object size to the text size break Keep the object width, break the too long lines and expand the object height dots Keep the size and write dots at the end if the text is too long scroll Keep the size and roll the text back and forth loop Keep the size and roll the text circularly crop Keep the size and crop the text out of it align string left Text alignment: left , center , right It's possible to set the color of characters in the text indvidually, just prefix the text to be re-colored with a #RRGGBB hexadecimal color code and a space, and close with a single hash # tag. Example jsonl 1 2 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"label\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 5 , \"w\" : 150 , \"h\" : 50 , \"text\" : \"\\uE64A Hello world!\" } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"label\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 5 , \"w\" : 150 , \"h\" : 50 , \"text\" : \"#0000FF \\uE64A# #FF0000 Hello# #008000 world#!\" } Button ~ obj: btn Property Value Default Description toggle bool false When enabled, creates a toggle-on/toggle-off button.

Pages ~ If the page parameter is not present, the object is placed on the same page as the previous object . If page is not specified for the first object either, the current page being displayed is used. \"page\":0 indicates that the object is visible on all pages. It can be used for example to specify a static menu bar. You can still hide the object on select pages if needed. Objects on page 0 appear on top of any objects on the underlying page. Actions ~ Action commands are supported only by binary or visual type of objects and they are performed locally on the plate. The following actions can be set for these objects: p1 to p12 to switch to the corresponding page numbers directly prev to switch to the previous page next to switch to the next page back to go back to the home page Check out the example for how to implement actions. You can change the target pages using prev , back and next page attributes operation on the page object pXb0 . Swipe ~ Objects and page area ( p0bY ) support swipe property. Enabling this will process left , right and down swipes on the object as next , prev and back page changes, respectively. The start of the swipe needs to be on the element which has this property enabled for the feature to activate. Note: Page id p0b0 is not valid to set this property as it has to be set on real elements. Events ~ All objects are touchable by default and respond to touch events. To disable touch events for an object set its enabled property to false . In this case the touch event \"goes through\" to the object on the layer below or to the page itself. Events (and values) are published in a state topic corresponding to the object, eg. hasp/<nodename>/state/p1b2 with payload in json format eg. {\"event\":\"up\",\"val\":1} . Possible events (depending on object type) are: Event Description down Occurs when a button goes from depressed to pressed (the moment of touch) up The button was released within a short time i.e. a short press has occurred release The button is released after being pressed for over the threshold time long Event is sent when the button is still being pressed after the threshold time of 400ms hold The HOLD event is repeated every 200ms while the button is still pressed changed Event is sent when the value of the object has changed during the event Tip: To actively see the sent out events you can use an MQTT client app and subscribe to the hasp/# topic. Common Methods ~ These are the common methods shared among all objects, Method Parameters Description clear Delete the children from the object delete Delete the object and its children from the page to_front Bring the object to the front on the page to_back Send the object to the back on the page Example commands: 1 2 p 1 b 5. dele te p 1 b 3. t o_ fr o nt Object Types Each object type is an ID that indicates which object type that line represents.

The jsonl lines are interpreted line-by-line. When a malformed line is encountered, the processing of the rest of the file stops. If you are missing objects, check the logs to see which line was processed last. You probably have a typo in the following line which blocks parsing the rest of the file. Blank lines are allowed for readability and are ignored. Note The complete file in its entirety is not a valid json file. Each individual line however must be a valid json object.

File comments ~ If any of the required id or obj properties are missing - and the line is still valid json - then it is interpreted as a comment. When you upload the file to your plate's flash filesystem, you can also use the page parameter in a comment to set the default page for new objects that don't have a page parameter. Example 1: Add a comment on a single line that is ignored. 1 { \"comment\" : \" ----------- Page 1 layout ------------\" } Example 2: Set the default page to 2 for objects in the following lines, besides adding a comment as well. 1 { \"page\" : 2 , \"comment\" : \" ---- My Awesome Color Picker Layout ----\" } If you then omit the page parameter in the lines below this comment, those objects will appear by default on page 2 .

Warning Some integrations like the custom component for Home Assistant can store the pages.jsonl centrally for your plates, in such cases you have the to specify the page number for each object, as those files are actually parsed line by line using the jsonl command. Objects ~ Each line in pages.jsonl creates one object on a page and has to be in the json format. The order of the objects also dictates the layer on the page from bottom to top. So the last drawn object will be the topmpost. Example Objects: 1 2 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"label\" , \"x\" : 5 , \"y\" : 5 , \"h\" : 50 , \"w\" : 50 , \"text\" : \"Hello\" , \"enabled\" : true , \"hidden\" : false } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 2 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 5 , \"y\" : 90 , \"h\" : 90 , \"w\" : 50 , \"text\" : \"World\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"hidden\" : false } Once the object is created, you can reference it with pXbY where X is the page number and Y is the id of the object. For example: 1 2 p 1 b 1. w= 100 p 1 b 2. hidde n = true Ids start from 1 on each page. You can have a maximum of 254 ids on each page. You don't have to use them in ascending order, you can for example use them for logical numbering (start labels from 11, 12, 13, buttons from 21, 22, 23 etc.) Page number 0 refers to an object visible on all pages. An id of 0 refers to the page itself instead of an object. Tip If you add the objects on the page 0 last, you ensure that they will be always be visible on top of all other pages. See objects documentation for details. Page attributes ~ A page can have the following attributes: prev : The number of the destination page when performing a page prev action on this page next : The number of the destination page when performing a page next action on this page back : The number of the destination page when performing a page back action on this page By default all pages cycle in a round-robin fashion (after the last page jump back to first), but you can change this behaviour by adjusting the prev , next and back target pages. For example, to limit cycle through page 1-5 only: on page 5, page next action will jump back to page 1: 1 { \"page\" : 5 , \"id\" : 0 , \"next\" : 1 } The corresponding command is p5b0.next=1 . on page 1, page prev action will go to page 5 (instead of default page 12 on an ESP32) 1 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 0 , \"prev\" : 5 } The corresponding command is p1b0.prev=5 . Tip Page id p0b0 (as all pages) is not valid to set this attribute for. It has to be set individually on each real page starting from 1. back acts like a level up action, so you can jump back to the home or menu page where you came from using page back .

The payload of the command corresponds to what's exactly in one line of the pages.jsonl file above. Objects ~ Each line in pages.jsonl creates one object on a page and has to be in the json format. The order of the objects also dictates the layer on the page from bottom to top. So the last drawn object will be the topmpost. Example Objects: 1 2 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"label\" , \"x\" : 5 , \"y\" : 5 , \"h\" : 50 , \"w\" : 50 , \"text\" : \"Hello\" , \"enabled\" : true , \"hidden\" : false } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 2 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 5 , \"y\" : 90 , \"h\" : 90 , \"w\" : 50 , \"text\" : \"World\" , \"enabled\" : false , \"hidden\" : false } Once the object is created, you can reference it with pXbY where X is the page number and Y is the id of the object. For example: 1 2 p 1 b 1. w= 100 p 1 b 2. hidde n = true Page number 0 refers to an object visible on all pages. An id of 0 refers to the page itself instead of an object. Tip: If you add the objects on the page 0 last, you ensure that they will be always be visible on top of all other pages. See objects dodumentation for details. Page attributes ~ A page can have the following attributes: prev : The number of the destination page when performing a page prev action on this page next : The number of the destination page when performing a page next action on this page back : The number of the destination page when performing a page back action on this page By default all pages cycle in a round-robin fashion (after the last page jump back to first), but you can change this behaviour by adjusting the prev , next and back target pages. For example, to limit cycle through page 1-5 only: on page 5, page next action will jump back to page 1: 1 { \"page\" : 5 , \"id\" : 0 , \"next\" : 1 } The corresponding command is p5b0.next=1 . on page 1, page prev action will go to page 5 (instead of default page 12 on an ESP32) 1 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 0 , \"prev\" : 5 } The corresponding command is p1b0.prev=5 . Note: Page id p0b0 (as all pages) is not valid to set this attribute as it has to be set on real pages individually. back acts like a level up action, so you can jump back to the home or menu page where you came from using page back .

Some objects allow for more complex styling, effectively changing their appearance or their sub-components. Certain more complex objects are made up of several sub-parts, which can be styled separately. To access the properties of the parts use a number suffix appended to the property. Tip For example the gauge object uses line_width to set the minor ticks thickness, line_width1 for major ticks and line_width2 for the thickness of the needle. Note: not all the suffixed properties are mentioned in this documentation, feel free to discover them yourself. If objects are children of other objects (they have the parentid property set), property inheritance takes place. Inheritance Some properties (typically that are related to text and opacity) can be inherited from the parent object's styles. Inheritance is applied only if the given property is not set in the initial jsonl of the child object (at first draw). In this case, if the property is inheritable, the property's value will be searched in the parents too until an object specifies a value for the property. The parents will use their own state to detemine the value. So for example if a button is pressed, and the text color comes from here, the pressed text color will be used. ( source ) Inheritance takes place at run time too. General ~ General styling options.

Both models have the same recessed housing sliding in the wall, sized 50x50mm, with rounded corners creating a diameter of about 59mm. This makes them suitable for both EU and US wall fixtures. The EU model fits in a properly deployed, standard 60mm round wall box and can be fixed with two side screws (use the screws which belong to the box instead of the ones shipped with the device), the US model fits in the standard rectangular box and can be fixed through the oval holes located 3 1/4\" apart.

Steps: Disengage the high-voltage power Detach the panel from the PSU power supply Connect RX, TX, IO0, GND and power pins to the female pinheader: Either supply 3.3V or 5V on the corresponding power pin, depending on the voltage supplied by the UART ttl (not both at the same time). Because there is no RESET pin, you need to powercycle the board with IO0 connected to GND to activate flash mode Once the serial connections are made, flash the Lanbon-L8 ESP32 binary like on any other device.

With Group ID object property combined with batch processing , objects on the screen can act on locally connected devices without using the home automation system - letting you use only these devices when the network is down. Prerequisites In the use case presented below, the following assumptions are made: you have a plate with 2 local relays (configured on output GPIOs as lights), each relay added to a different group (Group 1 and 2 respectively). you want to have 2 toggle buttons on the screen acting directly on these relays when the plate is not yet, or disconnected from the WiFi network. No page navigation is needed as no other objects related to the home automation services have to be displayed. The buttons have the groupid property set to 1 and 2 respectively. Configuration In the plate's web UI keep the default /pages.jsonl as Startup Layout. This will load immediately after plate boot, before the pate is connected to the network. If your network is not available after boot, this page configuration will be on screen while the plate keeps connecting in the background. pages.jsonl - loaded at boot, has only with objects related to local relays, and displays the hostname: 1 2 3 4 5 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 0 , \"y\" : 0 , \"w\" : 240 , \"h\" : 30 , \"text\" : \"LIGHTS\" , \"text_font\" : 16 , \"bg_color\" : \"#2C3E50\" , \"text_color\" : \"#FFFFFF\" , \"radius\" : 0 , \"border_side\" : 0 , \"click\" : 0 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 2 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 40 , \"w\" : 220 , \"h\" : 115 , \"toggle\" : true , \"text\" : \"\\uE335\" , \"text_font\" : 32 , \"mode\" : \"break\" , \"align\" : 1 , \"radius\" : 20 , \"groupid\" : 1 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 3 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 165 , \"w\" : 220 , \"h\" : 115 , \"toggle\" : true , \"text\" : \"\\uE335\" , \"text_font\" : 32 , \"mode\" : \"break\" , \"align\" : 1 , \"radius\" : 20 , \"groupid\" : 2 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 98 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 0 , \"y\" : 290 , \"w\" : 240 , \"h\" : 30 , \"bg_color\" : \"#2C3E50\" , \"text_color\" : \"#FFFFFF\" , \"radius\" : 0 , \"border_side\" : 0 , \"click\" : 0 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 99 , \"obj\" : \"label\" , \"x\" : 0 , \"y\" : 295 , \"w\" : 240 , \"align\" : \"center\" , \"text\" : \"%hostname%\" , \"text_color\" : \"#FFFFFF\" } You can use batch processing and create scripts which run when the plate connects to the WiFi network or loses connection from it. online.cmd - batch script to run after connected to the WiFi network, it will clear the screen and load the pages with objects related to the home automation: 1 2 clearpage all run /pages_online.jsonl pages_online.jsonl - to be loaded after connected to the WiFi network: Put in pages_online.jsonl the main configuration for the pages you'd like to use when the pate is connected to the network and the home automation system. See integrations examples corresponding to the home automation system you have. Note If you use Home Assistant and opt to store the pages.jsonl file on the server, which will be loaded on start of Home Assistant, it will also be reloaded on plate becoming online. Don't put run /pages_online.jsonl in the script and don't need pages_online.jsonl either on the plate. offline.cmd - batch script to run when connection is lost from the WiFi network, it will clear the screen and load the page only with objects related to local relays: 1 2 clearpage all run /pages_offline.jsonl pages_offline.jsonl - to be loaded after connection is lost to the WiFi network, has only with objects related to local relays: 1 2 3 4 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 0 , \"y\" : 0 , \"w\" : 240 , \"h\" : 30 , \"text\" : \"LIGHTS\" , \"text_font\" : 16 , \"bg_color\" : \"#2C3E50\" , \"text_color\" : \"#FFFFFF\" , \"radius\" : 0 , \"border_side\" : 0 , \"click\" : 0 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 2 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 40 , \"w\" : 220 , \"h\" : 115 , \"toggle\" : true , \"text\" : \"\\uE335\" , \"text_font\" : 32 , \"mode\" : \"break\" , \"align\" : 1 , \"radius\" : 20 , \"groupid\" : 1 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 3 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 165 , \"w\" : 220 , \"h\" : 115 , \"toggle\" : true , \"text\" : \"\\uE335\" , \"text_font\" : 32 , \"mode\" : \"break\" , \"align\" : 1 , \"radius\" : 20 , \"groupid\" : 2 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 99 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 0 , \"y\" : 290 , \"w\" : 240 , \"h\" : 30 , \"text\" : \"\\uE156\\uE5A9\" , \"text_font\" : 16 , \"bg_color\" : \"#2C3E50\" , \"text_color\" : \"#FFFFFF\" , \"radius\" : 0 , \"border_side\" : 0 , \"click\" : 0 } Testing Reboot the plate. First only the buttons related to local relays are shown, these act the relays. After the plate connects to the network, screen is cleared and home automation-related pages are loaded. Kill the WiFi network. Plate detects the disconnection from the network, thus screen is cleared and only the buttons related to local relays are shown, relays can be turned on and off. Restore the WiFi network.

You can map any service supported by any entity in Home Assistant to any object event in openHASP, moreover, you can set any property of any object in openHASP to any value from Home Assistant. This powerful concept gives you full freedom to create a completely customized, hardware-based control user interface for your home automation. We call plate any device running openHASP in your system. Installation ~ You have the option to install the custom component using HACS or via manual download: Using HACS Install using HACS in one-click. This is the preferred and recommended method, as HACS provides a very effective way to keep the component updated and/or choose between various versions. Goto Home Assistant > HACS > Integrations . Click the Explore & Add Repositories button. Search for openHASP and click on the openHasp logo. Click Install this repository in HACS . Note: To install the current unstable development version select the Main . Click Install Reboot Home-Assistant Manual Install Alternatively, you can also install it manually: Download ZIP Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find configuration.yaml ). If you do not have a custom_components directory there, you need to create it. In the custom_components directory create a new folder called openhasp . Download all the files from the custom_components/openhasp/ directory in this repository. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory you created. Edit your configuration.yaml file add an entry similar to the example below. Restart Home Assistant Note The download {target= blank} link points to the actual _development code in the master branch. Warning You have to use component version consistently with the firmware version on your plates. For example, if your plates are at firmware version 0.6.x, you also need to use component version 0.6.x to ensure interoperability. Home Assistant will show a warning if it finds a version mismatch. Note that you can only have one version of the component installed at a time so a mix of plate versions cannot be deployed. Configuration ~ First prepare your plates to be integrated with Home Assistant (follow steps in order): Connect your plates to the network . Static DHCP or fixed IP is not needed as communication only happes through MQTT. Set the GPIO configuration corresponding to your hardware (important for them to be detected as entities), save and reboot. Restart Home Assistant. Set the MQTT server settings and make sure each plate has a unique node name, save and reboot. The component will automatically discover the plates and you will see them appearing in Home Assistant > Configuration > Integrations > HASP-Open Hardware Edition . When Home Assistant detects your plate, you will have to give it a name. In the examples below both name and node name is plate35 . You will be presented with options to set the backlight brightness level when the plate is idle and optionally you can set a path to a centrally located pages.jsonl file containing design for this plate - the component can send the contents of the file when the plate connects. From v0.6.3 of the component this file can also be a file with a .json extenstion. See the JSON Files section below. Note If you opt to store the pages.jsonl file on Home Assistant server, it will only be loaded on start of Home Assistant and reloaded on plate availability (becoming online). Optionally you should also check how to handle the offline state of the plate. Currently you will get a warning that you need to add manual configuration for the objects in your configuration.yaml , that's no problem, read ahead. Example ~ To add an openHASP plate to your installation with a sample configuration, upload a pages.jsonl file with the folowing content to your plate first: 1 2 3 4 { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 0 , \"y\" : 0 , \"w\" : 240 , \"h\" : 30 , \"text\" : \"openHASP\" , \"value_font\" : 22 , \"bg_color\" : \"#2C3E50\" , \"text_color\" : \"#FFFFFF\" , \"radius\" : 0 , \"border_side\" : 0 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 2 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 40 , \"w\" : 105 , \"h\" : 90 , \"toggle\" : true , \"text\" : \"\\uE335\" , \"text_font\" : 32 , \"mode\" : \"break\" , \"align\" : 1 } { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 3 , \"obj\" : \"dropdown\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 140 , \"w\" : 170 , \"h\" : 30 , \"options\" : \"Apples\\nBananas\\nOranges\\nMelon\" } { \"page\" : 0 , \"id\" : 1 , \"obj\" : \"label\" , \"x\" : 175 , \"y\" : 5 , \"h\" : 30 , \"w\" : 62 , \"text\" : \"00.0\u00b0C\" , \"align\" : 2 , \"bg_color\" : \"#2C3E50\" , \"text_color\" : \"#FFFFFF\" } Assuming your plate's configured MQTT node name is plate35 , add the following to your configuration.yaml file (Home Assistant will deliberatey ask for it when finished autodetection procedure): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 openhasp : plate35 : objects : - obj : \"p0b1\" # temperature label on all pages properties : \"text\" : '{{ states(\"sensor.my_room_temperature\") }}\u00b0C' - obj : \"p1b2\" # light-switch toggle button properties : \"val\" : '{{ 1 if states(\"light.my_room\") == \"on\" else 0 }}' \"text\" : '{{ \"\\uE6E8\" if is_state(\"light.my_room\", \"on\") else \"\\uE335\" | e }}' event : \"up\" : - service : homeassistant.toggle entity_id : \"light.my_room\" - obj : \"p1b3\" # dropdown event : \"changed\" : - service : persistent_notification.create data : message : I like {{ text }} Variable definitions ~ openhasp: (Required) The platform identifier. Required once in the configuration. plate35: (Required) Your plate identifier slug. For each plate in your sytem, such an entry is required, has to be unique. It is generated automatically from the plate name you gave during discovery, which by default equals to the HASP Node Name set in the plate's configuration . objects: (Optional) Definition of the objects reacting to changes in Home Assistant, or generating events for Home Assistant. obj: (string) (Required) The object identifier which we want to integrate with Home Assistant. Its name has the form pXbY where X represents the page where the object is located, and Y represents the id of the object on that page. properties: (Optional) List containing the properties of the object which we want to modify based on changes occurring in Home Assistant. In the example above text property gets updated whenever sensor.my_room_temperature changes. event: (Optional) List containing the events generated by the object when touched on the screen. These are object-specific and can be observed accurately with an MQTT client. Each event defines a list of services which will be processed in order (like actions list in an automation). In the example above, when object p1b2 (which is a toggle button) generates the on event, light.my_room will be turned on by the service call light.turn_on as specified in the event config. And similarily when off event comes through MQTT, the light will be turned off by the corresponding service call. Note Any variable coming from the MQTT message can be used between curly brackets and passed to the service call. In the example above when object p1b3 (which is a dropdown selector) generates the changed event, a persistent notification will appear in Home Assistant's Lovelace interface containing the selected text from the object, which was passed over from the MQTT message. See object events for more types of generated events. Configuration tips ~ Multiple plates ~ If you have multiple plates you can add them all using different plate identifiers. Their configured topics have to be unique too: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 openhasp : plate_my_room_1 : objects : # ... plate_my_room_2 : objects : # ... plate_my_room_3 : objects : # ... Split configuration ~ You can use Home Assistant's split configuration to help better organizing your config files. Instead of keeping the configuration of all openHASP plates in Home Assistant's main config file, you can keep openHASP config separately, by adding only this to configuration.yaml : openhasp: !include openhasp.yaml After this, you can move your openHASP configuration starting with plate_my_room: level to your separate openhasp.yaml file and restart Home Assistant. Moreover, if you have multiple plates, you can keep each one in a separate config file, to achieve this, make it like: openhasp: !include_dir_merge_named openhasp_configs/ Create a directory openhasp_configs right near configuration.yaml , and put in it all your plates configuration (only with plate_my_room: level) in separate yaml files and restart Home Assistant. Services ~ This component implements some specific services to make interactions with the plate even more comfortable. openhasp.wakeup Wakes up the display when an external event has occurred, like a presence or a PIR motion sensor. openhasp.next_page Changes plate to the next page. openhasp.prev_page Changes plate to the previous page. openhasp.change_page Changes plate directly to the specified page number. openhasp.clear_page Clears the contents of the specified page number. If page number not specified, clears all the pages. openhasp.load_pages Loads new design from pages.jsonl file from full path on Home Assistant server. The file must be located in an authorised location defined by allowlist_external_dirs (in case of hassio /config/ is the directory where Home Assistant's configuration.yaml resides, so in case of a subdirectory called openhasp the full path would be e.g. /config/openhasp/pages.jsonl , and you need to add /config/openhasp/ to your allowlist_external_dirs ). Note The contents of the file are loaded line by line thus \"page\":X has to be defined for each object. Unless you clear the page first, the objects will be updated. For example, to allow read-access to the folder, add these lines to your configuration.yaml : 1 2 3 homeassistant : allowlist_external_dirs : - \"/config/openhasp\" openhasp.command Wraps up any command so that it can be called against the entity_id of the plate. Useful in Automations and Blueprints. Warning This service handles data without input validation. Only for advanced users. No support for any problems caused by using this! openhasp.config Wraps up any raw submodule config so that it can be called against the entity_id of the plate. Useful in Automations and Blueprints. Warning This service handles data without input validation. Only for advanced users. No support for any problems caused by using this! Check out the example confgurations and automations to learn how to use these services within Home Assistant. JSON Files ~ From v0.6.3 pages file supplied in the plate config within home assistant can be a .json , files with this extension will be parsed differently and expect a JSON array containing objects or strings. Objects must be valid JSONL lines and strings can be used for comments. As this file is valid JSON whitespace will be ignored when parsing and removed before sending the JSONL data to the plate. If you are storing your plate config along with your HA config, this allows you to have more readable config which will be formatted in your editor of choice. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 [ { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 2 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 10 , \"y\" : 40 , \"w\" : 105 , \"h\" : 90 , \"toggle\" : false , \"text\" : \"Normal Button\" , \"mode\" : \"break\" , \"align\" : \"center\" }, \"Comment string will be removed when parsing\" , { \"page\" : 1 , \"id\" : 3 , \"obj\" : \"btn\" , \"x\" : 125 , \"y\" : 40 , \"w\" : 105 , \"h\" : 90 , \"toggle\" : true , \"text\" : \"#FFD700 Toggle# Button\" , \"mode\" : \"break\" , \"align\" : \"center\" } ] Debugging ~ Add these lines to your main configuration.yaml configuration and restart Home Assistant: 1 2 3 4 logger : default : warning logs : custom_components.openhasp : debug Look for the debug messages in the home-assistant.log file.","title":"How-To"},{"location":"integrations/home-assistant/howto/#installation","text":"You have the option to install the custom component using HACS or via manual download: Using HACS Install using HACS in one-click.

Wall mounted LCD screns main problem is that they display the same picture 99.999% of the time. Even if somebody turns off backlight during the night or dark periods, the LCD screen keeps showing the same picture, seen by nobody. There are high chances that this will lead to screen picture burn-in after a few years of operation. Pixel training One way to reduce this is to \"train\" the pixels periodically with completely different other content. Assuming your group name is configured as plates in your 240x320 screens running openHASP, here is a possible solution to extend their life (all at once).

Log messages like Error while processing template or Template variable error: 'None' has no attribute 'last_changed' etc. can be caused by the fact that openHASP component loads faster than the other integrations you have set up, from where you want to pull data. Because the data required by openHASP component is not yet available, an error is generated. But as soon as Home Assistant finishes loading everything, and all the data you've configured is available, things will be normal. Nevertheless the log should be checked regularly to find repetitive problems.

By multiplying and dividing by 100, it becomes possible to set volume between 0 and 1 as required by Home Assistant. Generic thermostat/climate ~ This example is a bit more complex in the aspect that it uses several objects put on top of each other, and grouped toghether using the parentid parameter. Special attention goes to an invisible tabview (exteding over the label dispaying the target temperarture) which allows for swiping between an on/off switch and dropdowns for setting the hvac and fan modes. The target temperature can be set by dragging the arc handle, more precise +/- setting possible by short/long pressing the middle circle containing the current temperature (increasing/decreasing the value by the temperature step defined by the climate entity). Note that the min , max and val values of the arc and gauge are multiplied and divided by 10 when set and read, because LVGL only suppports integers for object values. By multiplying and dividing by 10, it becomes possible to set decimal values for climate temperature. The number of the ticks on the gauge is determined from the min , max attributes of the configured climate, likewise the hvac_modes and fan_modes dropdowns. You can localise these using the if-else statements of the template in the configuration of the custom component. The active area of the arc changes color based on the current hvac mode of the entity. UI theme set to Hasp Light in plate's web interface. Note that the tab swiping dots ( p3b26 ) are also handled by the custom component. Don't forget update the service call in the configuration with your plate's MQTT node name, and the command parameters if you change the page of the objects.

On the top area the current weather is shown, on the bottom area the user can choose by swiping between next hours and next days forecast. This is achieved by a tabview object with invisible tabs. Since there's no weather integration in Home Assistant which can offer so much information at once, this can be achieved by installing multiple weather components. In our example we use two: Met.no (the one coming by default pre-installed) for next days forecast. OpenWeatherMap (available as standard integration to be activated) for next hours forecast. You need to set the forecast mode to onecall_hourly to get forecasts for the day's next hours. The openHASP component grabs information from both weather sources and updates them on every change. The various strings containing day names, day periods, weather conditions can be localized easily to any language within the configuration. Weather condition icons are displayed from the internal flash space of the plate. For this, you need to upload the desired icon pack to the plate: light theme dark theme To unzip them on the plate, connect via Telnet and run the command unzip /openhasp-weathericons-day.zip to unzip the light theme above (alternatively you can unzip them on your computer and upload them one by one). The configuration example only shows how to use the light theme icons. Icons are copyright from manifestinteractive and merlinthered . This example implements Home Assistant's standard weather conditions only (as in 2021.06), so any weather integration component can be used. Some integrations know extra conditions in addition to the standard ones, those (with their corresponding icons) can be easily added to the component configuration below. Note that the tab swiping dots ( p5b10 ) are also handled by the custom component. Don't forget update the service call in the configuration with your plate's MQTT node name, and the command parameters if you change the page of the objects. relevant openHASP config: (screen size

Special attention goes to an invisible tabview (exteding over the label dispaying the target temperarture) which allows for swiping between an on/off switch and dropdowns for setting the hvac and fan modes. The target temperature can be set by dragging the arc handle, more precise +/- setting possible by short/long pressing the middle circle containing the current temperature (increasing/decreasing the value by the temperature step defined by the climate entity). Note that the min , max and val values of the arc and gauge are multiplied and divided by 10 when set and read, because LVGL only suppports integers for object values. By multiplying and dividing by 10, it becomes possible to set decimal values for climate temperature. The number of the ticks on the gauge is determined from the min , max attributes of the configured climate, likewise the hvac_modes and fan_modes dropdowns. You can localise these using the if-else statements of the template in the configuration of the custom component. The active area of the arc changes color based on the current hvac mode of the entity. UI theme set to Hasp Light in plate's web interface. Note that the tab swiping dots ( p3b26 ) are also handled by the custom component. Don't forget update the service call in the configuration with your plate's MQTT node name, and the command parameters if you change the page of the objects.

On the top area the current weather is shown, on the bottom area the user can choose by swiping between next hours and next days forecast. This is achieved by a tabview object with invisible tabs. Since there's no weather integration in Home Assistant which can offer so much information at once, this can be achieved by installing multiple weather components. In our example we use two: Met.no (the one coming by default pre-installed) for next days forecast. OpenWeatherMap (available as standard integration to be activated) for next hours forecast. You need to set the forecast mode to onecall_hourly to get forecasts for the day's next hours. The openHASP component grabs information from both weather sources and updates them on every change. The various strings containing day names, day periods, weather conditions can be localized easily to any language within the configuration. Weather condition icons are displayed from the internal flash space of the plate. For this, you need to upload the desired icon pack to the plate: light theme dark theme To unzip them on the plate, connect via Telnet and run the command unzip /openhasp-weathericons-day.zip to unzip the light theme above (alternatively you can unzip them on your computer and upload them one by one). The configuration example only shows how to use the light theme icons. Icons are copyright from manifestinteractive and merlinthered . This example implements Home Assistant's standard weather conditions only (as in 2021.06), so any weather integration component can be used. Some integrations know extra conditions in addition to the standard ones, those (with their corresponding icons) can be easily added to the component configuration below. Note that the tab swiping dots ( p5b10 ) are also handled by the custom component. Don't forget update the service call in the configuration with your plate's MQTT node name, and the command parameters if you change the page of the objects. relevant openHASP config: (screen size
